# Stop hook: after a "bigger" task (heuristic: >= TOOL_THRESHOLD tool-use events
# in the transcript), prompt Claude to reflect on whether anything from the
# conversation is worth adding to or updating in docs/.
#
# Mechanism: emit {"decision":"block","reason":"..."} on stdout. That prevents
# Claude from stopping and continues the conversation with the `reason` as the
# next instruction. Loop guard: if the payload's `stop_hook_active` is true,
# we're already inside a continuation — exit 0 so Claude can actually stop.
